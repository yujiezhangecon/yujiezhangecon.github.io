I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the [Universtity of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/class/economics/), specializing in Applied Microeconomics. My research interests encompass environmental issues, health, education, family dynamics, and gender inequality, with a primary focus on developing countries. I explore the short- and long-term effects of climatic shocks on human capital, examining how these impacts vary by gender and socio-economic status. 

I am a Doctoral Researcher for the [PIRE Project](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/partnerships-international-research-education-pire-0), focusing on [climate risk, pollution, and childhood inequalities in low- and middle-income countries](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2230615). I am also collaborating on research related to climate change and health with [Asian Development Bank](https://www.adb.org/).
