I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the [Universtity of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/class/economics/), specializing in Applied Microeconomics. 

My research encompasses environment, health, education, and inequality, particularly in developing countries. Recent work investigates the short- and long-term effects of climatic shocks on human capital, highlighting disparities by gender and socio-economic status. 

As a Doctoral Researcher for the [PIRE Project](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/partnerships-international-research-education-pire-0), I explore [climate risk, pollution, and childhood inequalities in low- and middle-income countries](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2230615) (Investigators: [Emily Hannum](https://sociology.sas.upenn.edu/people/emily-hannum), [Jere Behrman](https://economics.sas.upenn.edu/people/jere-r-behrman), and [Fan Wang](https://fanwangecon.github.io/)). 
I am also collaborating with [Minhaj Mahmud](https://blogs.adb.org/author/minhaj-mahmud) on climate change and human capital for [Asian Development Bank](https://www.adb.org/).
