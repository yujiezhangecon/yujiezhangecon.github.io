I am a PhD student in Economics at the [Universtity of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/class/economics/). 

I am interested in Applied Microeconomics including topics related to environment, health, education, family, and gender inequality. 

Here is my <a href="/files/cv/YujieZhang_CV.pdf">CV</a>. You can also check the [CV](https://yujiezhangecon.github.io/cv/) page to know more about me. 

You can pronounce my name as "UG / You-Gee Cheung". This site is still under construction, so please forgive missing items such as pictures, descriptions, etc.
