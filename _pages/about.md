I am a fifth-year Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the [University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/class/economics/). 
My research interests lie in the fields of Development Economics. My recent research explores the intersections between climate change, human capital, and social inequality through transnational comparative studies and large-scale data analysis. 

<!---
My research encompasses environment, health, education, labor, and inequality, particularly in developing countries. Recent work investigates the short- and long-term effects of climatic shocks on human capital, highlighting disparities by gender and socio-economic status.

My Job Market Paper investigates the long-term effects of natural disasters on education, health, and labor outcomes, highlighting disparities by gender and socio-economic status.
I collaborate with [Jere R. Behrman](https://economics.sas.upenn.edu/people/jere-r-behrman), [Emily Hannum](https://sociology.sas.upenn.edu/people/emily-hannum), and [Fan Wang](https://fanwangecon.github.io/), alongside scholars from institutes such as the University of Pennsylvania and the Inter-American Development Bank, to explore climate risk, pollution, and childhood inequalities in low- and middle-income countries, sponsored by the [U.S. National Science Foundation - PIRE](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/partnerships-international-research-education-pire-0). 
I also work with [Minhaj Mahmud](https://blogs.adb.org/author/minhaj-mahmud) on temperature, pollution, and social welfare for the [Asian Development Bank](https://www.adb.org/).

I am on the 2024-2025 job market.

## My research interests in topics related to environment, health, education, family, and gender inequality.
